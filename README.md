### Goal: Create a personal Express app that has two or more CRUD features.

### Process:

<ol>
  <li>The ideation for this project took the most time.</li>
  <li>I had many ideas, but none of them really seemed to be the one at the time.  I figured, "hey, I like words," so why not make another word themed app?</li>
  <li>I created a function in the main.js that collected data from an API I made.  Making these is actually kinda kind, I've found.</li>
  <li>The API was an object of consisted of a word and its definition.  Another function randomized the index of a word from the API and then displays it in the DOM as the 'Word of the Day.'</li>
   <li>Along with the word of the day, the definition for that same word is posted in the DOM, but given a class with the color of 'white' so it does not display. (I could have done display; none; but because of the way the boxes were style in bootstrap, it made it a little cleaner so the words don't just blink into existence.). A button was then tied to the remove the class.</li>  
   <li>As for my CRUD, well the user could now post whatver the define the word as, and others can upvote and downvote and delete the comments.</li>
  <li>One core feature that I would add if given the time is the ability to delete a user defintion automatically if it has too many negative votes.</li>
  <li>All in all, though, done and dusted.</li>

<p>Overall, this one was nice.  Very simple, very clean and it works.  I'm solid.</p>

<ul>
  <li>I completed the challenge: | 5 <em>My CRUDs are in there; check 'em and see.</em></li>
  <li>I feel good about my code: | 3 <em>I feel like I could do a bit more with this, like the aforementioned auto-delete, just too keep things interesting, but the bare bones is there.</em></li>
</ul>
